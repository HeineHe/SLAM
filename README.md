# Code Structure of LIO-Livox (A Robust LiDAR-Inertial Odometry for Livox LiDAR)
This readme file is a code explaination of code structure of LIO-Livox **Developer**: [Livox](www.livoxtech.com). 

This algorithm implements a robust SLAM algorithm on Livox LiDARs with built-in IMU.

The overall algothm composes  4 files and 7 folders. 4 files are a CMakeLists.txt, a license, a readme.md and a package.xml, and 7 folds are cmake, config, doc, include, launch, rviz_cfg, and src. 

CMakeLists claims minimum required cmake version, standard of cmake compiler, required packages, required dictionaries, required ROS packages, executable files' name, linking realationships and libraries. 

Lisense is like the BSD 3-Clause Lisence with preserved rights.

readme.md introduces the algo and provides tutorials to repeat it.

Package.xml file defines the  packages' features, mainly name here.
