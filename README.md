# Code Structure of LIO-Livox (A Robust LiDAR-Inertial Odometry for Livox LiDAR)
This readme file is a code explaination of code structure of LIO-Livox **Developer**: [Livox](www.livoxtech.com). 

This algorithm implements a robust SLAM algorithm on Livox LiDARs with built-in IMU.

The overall algothm composes  4 files and 7 folders. 7 folds are cmake, config, doc, include, launch, rviz_cfg, and src. 4 files are a CMakeLists.txt, a license, a readme.md and a package.xml.
